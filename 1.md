# type casting
float x = 3.14 
int y = (int)x

# static 
- there are static inner classes ,fuctions , variables but no function can have a variable declared as static
- instance variables are created everytime an object is created but static variable is created only once and is accessible within the class
- it is made as class specific not object specific
- no matter how many objects are created only one static variable will be declared and accessed
- access by dot operator
- static member function access only static member variables and not instance variables because instance variables need to be assigned to an object 
- if a static variable is declared private then it cannot be accessed with dot operator outside class's scope it can only be accessed by its member functions

# Wrapper Classes
- primitive data types are not a part of OOP so in order to make primitive data as a class and use its instance we have wrapper classes
- Wrapper classes encapsulates a single value for the primitive data type.
  
## Useful methods
- valueOf() static method
- parseX() static method
- xValue() instance method
