used to import classes of packages
# Access Modifiers
- private
- protected

- default

## For Outer Class 
Either class is public Or default
## For inner Class
Any Access Modifier can be used

## Important Points
- There has to be only one public class in a file , there can't be two public classes in a file, also a package can have multiple public classes but every public class has to be in a separate file.
- private classes cannot be accessed from outside the class body, they are meant to be accessed directly from same class.
- protected classes can be accessed from same package and child class from other package
- public classes are accessible from any class of any package
- default classes are accessible from classes of same package

# Constructors
- It is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called implicitly just after the memory is allocated for the object .
- It is a member function of class and name is same as of class
- has no return type
  
# Inheritance
- There is no multiple Inheritance in java. Each class is allowed to have only one parent class.
- A parent class can have any number of subclasses
- Private members of parent class are not accessible by the subclass and can only be indirectly accessed.
- default members of superclass are not accessible by subclass in other packages.
## Supported Types
- Single Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
