# Import 
used to import classes of packages
# Access Modifiers
- private
- protected 
- public
- default

## For Outer Class 
Either class is public Or default
## For inner Class
Any Access Modifier can be used

## Important Points
- There has to be only one public class in a file , there can't be two public classes in a file, also a package can have multiple public classes but every public class has to be in a separate file.
- private classes cannot be accessed from outside the class body, they are meant to be accessed directly from same class.
- protected classes can be accessed from same package and child class from other package
- public classes are accessible from any class of any package
- default classes are accessible from classes of same package

# Constructors
- It is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called implicitly just after the memory is allocated for the object .
- It is a member function of class and name is same as of class
- has no return type
  
# Inheritance
- There is no multiple Inheritance in java. Each class is allowed to have only one parent class.
- A parent class can have any number of subclasses
- Private members of parent class are not accessible by the subclass and can only be indirectly accessed.
- default members of superclass are not accessible by subclass in other packages.
- any static or non static member funcions are inherited from parent class to child class.
- static member variables are not inherited

### Supported Types
- Single Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance

### function hiding
any static function if inherited from parent to child class and child class has a function of same signature then it is called function hiding.

### Constructors in inheritance
- subclass constructor invokes constructor of superclass.

# Initialization Block
## Instance Initialization block
- An instance initializer or initialization block declared in a class is executed when an instance of the class is created
- return keyword cannot be used in initialization block
- instance initializers are permitted to reffer to the current object via the keyword this and to use the keyword super

## Static Initialization block
- declared inside the class and executed when class is initialized.
- static initialization block cannot access instance members.
- It is run before the object is created.
- No matter how many objects created but static block is run only once.
- return , this or super cannot be used in static block.
  
# Final
## instance variable
- A java variable can be declared using the keyword final then final variable can be assigned only once. 
- Final variable can be declared by 3 ways : during variable init , by init block, or by a constructor.
- if not declared it is called blank final variable. And it forces either the constructors to initialize it or initialization block to declare.
## static variable
- same as instance
- static init block is used to declare, or during init
## local variable
once init cannot be changed
## Class and methods
classes cannot be inherited or extended.
Methods cannot be overridden.

# this
- the 'this' object reference is a local variable in instance member methods referring the caller object
- this keyword is used as a reference to the current object which is an instance of the current class.
- if a method needs to pass the current object to another method it can do so using the this reference.

# Super
- It is also a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects . It is helpful in inheritance.
- It is used to refer to parent class variables , methods and constructors.
- diffference btw this and super is that this refers to subclass type but super refers to parent class.
- It avoids name conflict between member variables of superclass and subclass.
