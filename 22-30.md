# Constructor chaining
- Constructor can call other constructors of the same class or superclass.
- constructor call from a constructor must be the first step ( call should appear in first line). eg. this(params)
- such series of invocation of constructors is known as constructor chaining.
- chained constructor never contains super() and this() both. first line of this constructor is either super() or this() **super by default**

# Abstract Classes
- created using abstract keyword.
- cant be instantiated or is not used to create object.
- used to declare common characteristics of subclasses 
- it can only be used as a superclass for other classes that extends the abstract class.
- like any other class an abstract class can contain field that describe the characteristics and methods that describe the actions that a class can perform.
- we can create reference variables of these classes.
  - `A obj = new b()`

## Abstract Methods
- The methods which do not have any implementation , included within abstract class.
  - `abstract double calcInterest();`
- the abstract method declaration must then end with a semicolon rather than a block.
- If a class has any abstract methods whether declared or inherited the entire class must be declared abstract.
- Use of abstract method is that if want to force child class to declare some function by over riding then abstract method can be declared in parent class.

# Interface
- in Interfaces specify the method declaration (implicitly public and abstract ) and can only contain firlds ( which are implicitly public static final)
- implicit declaration given above are applied by default **no need to give access modifier**
- cannot be instantiated.
- do not have constructors.
- A class implementing an interface must overide all the methods given in interface otherwise class needs to be declared abstract , same goes for any extended class.
- Possible statements
  - `interface I3 extends I1,I2{...}`
  - ` class b extends A implements I3,I4 `
- we cannot create object of any interface but creation of object reference is possible.
- object reference of interface can refer to any of its subclass type.

## Difference btw abstract class and interface
- abstract class members can have any access modifiers. Inerface can have only public members.
- abstract class can contain abstract methods or methods with definition. Interface can only have methods without definition ie by default methods.
- abstract class have static and non static member variables, interfaces have all member variables static
- same for final.
- interface do not have constructors.
