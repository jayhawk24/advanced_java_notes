# Constructor chaining
- Constructor can call other constructors of the same class or superclass.
- constructor call from a constructor must be the first step ( call should appear in first line). eg. this(params)
- such series of invocation of constructors is known as constructor chaining.
- chained constructor never contains super() and this() both. first line of this constructor is either super() or this() **super by default**

# Abstract Classes
- created using abstract keyword.
- cant be instantiated or is not used to create object.
- used to declare common characteristics of subclasses 
- it can only be used as a superclass for other classes that extends the abstract class.
- like any other class an abstract class can contain field that describe the characteristics and methods that describe the actions that a class can perform.
- we can create reference variables of these classes.
  - `A obj = new b()`

## Abstract Methods
- The methods which do not have any implementation , included within abstract class.
- the abstract method declaration must then end with a semicolon rather than a block.
- If a class has any abstract methods whether declared or inherited the entire class must be declared abstract.
