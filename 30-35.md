# String
- A java.lang.String class is final which implies no class can extend it.
- Sting class is immutable i.e Strings in java once created and initialized cannot be changed on the same refference.
- If two or more strings have the same set of characters int the same sequence then they share the same reference in memory.
  - ` String str1 = "import sys"; String str2 = " import sys"; String str3 = " import "+"sys";`
  - All the string references str1,2,3 denote the same string object.
- if we use new keyword to create a String then even if two strings are same new memory is allocated everytime.
  - ` String str5 = new String("import sys")`

    ### String Methods
- toUpperCase()
- to LowerCase()
- indexOf(int ch, int fromIndex)  2nd args is optional 1st arg also accepts string.
- lastIndexOf(int ch / String str, int fromIndex) 2nd arg is optional
- equals()
- equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString)
- compareTo(String s)
- substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) 2nd arg is opt

# Exception Handling
- Exceptions in java are any abnormal, unexpectedd events or extraordinary conditions that may occur at runtime.
- Four options
  - Default throw and default catch
  - Default throw and our catch
  - Our throw and default catch
  - our throw and out catch
- Default exceptions in java
  - IO Exception
  - ClassNotFoundException
  - Runtime Exception
    - Illegal Args Exception
    - Null pointer exception
    - Arithmetic Exception
    - Number format exception
- Throw exceptions are raised with the throw keyword and hadled within a catch block.
  ## Throwable Class
  - This class is super class of all exception classes.
  - Throwable class provides a string variable that can be set by the subclasses to provide a detail message that provides more information of the exception occured.
  - All classes of throwables define a one-parameter constructor that takes a string as the detail message.
  - The class throwable provides getMessage() function to retrieve an exception.
2 Types of exceptions
### Unchecked Exceptions
- Runtime exceptions and any of tis subclasses
- Array indexoutof bounds, nullpointer exception and so on are all subclasses of the java.lang.runtime exception class.
### Checked Exceptions
All those exceptions other than runtime exceptions like IO excep. ClassNotfound excep.
- Syntax
  ` try { ... code where you expect exception } 
  catch(<exception type><parameter>){
      0 or more <statements>
  }
  finally{
      finally block statements.
  }`
- finally runs even if an exception is thrown or not
- for each try lock there can be none or any number of catch blocks but only one finally block
- the catch locks ad finally block must always appear in conjunction with a try block.
- A try block must be followed y either a catch block or finally lock
- the order exception handlers in the catch block must be from the most specific exception.
