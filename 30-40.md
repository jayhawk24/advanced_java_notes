# String
- A java.lang.String class is final which implies no class can extend it.
- Sting class is immutable i.e Strings in java once created and initialized cannot be changed on the same refference.
- If two or more strings have the same set of characters int the same sequence then they share the same reference in memory.
  - ` String str1 = "import sys"; String str2 = " import sys"; String str3 = " import "+"sys";`
  - All the string references str1,2,3 denote the same string object.
- if we use new keyword to create a String then even if two strings are same new memory is allocated everytime.
  - ` String str5 = new String("import sys")`
